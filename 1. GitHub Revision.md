```
Create an EC2 instance. Create a 'Scripts' folder. and now Create some bash scripts in it. i.e "Thalapathy.sh", "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh", "hello.sh", "install_package.sh", "variables.sh".

Note : There are 3 stages. i.e Untracked (red), Staged (green) and Tracked. 

Now go into the Scripts folder i.e 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Thalapathy.s  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh


Now you need to initialize an Empty Git Repo in this folder i.e Scripts.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git init 

It will create an .git file in this folder. But to see all the hidden files, you need to use below command : 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh

To see all the files status, you need to use "git status" command. 
You can see all the files in Red color. Thats because those are currently Untracked Files.

Now you need to move the "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh" file from Untracked to Staged status. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add gabbar_vs_thakur.sh

Then use 'git status' command to check if the file has been moved into the Staged state or not. It should move into the Staged state.
You can see that particular file in Green color. 
Add another file i.e "variables.sh" into the Staged state. 

Imagine you didn't required to move "Variables.sh" file into Staged state, so you need to move it back into the Untracked state.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git rm --cached variables.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status 
Using "git status" you can see that now 'Variables.sh' file got moved back into the Untracked state. 

Now you need to move the "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh" file from Staged to Tracked state.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Adding Sholey movie script"
Now your file got Tracked state.


Now some one from your team, had mistakenly deleted the "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh" file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ rm gabbar_vs_thakur
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
You can see the file got removed. But it will be there in Version Control.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
You can see that some changes has happened. 
Now you need to get back that deleted file. i.e "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh"
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git restore gabbar_vs_thakur.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Restored !!! 


Note : To add all the files in the folder into Staged state, you can use "git add ." but don't use it. 

You will notice that after every action by you on GitHub, you are getting all the info. But you only want the requried one.
So now here you need to configure you git.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git config --global user.name BhimsenK
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git config --global user.email kulkarnibhimsen4@gmail.com
Now create a new file i.e README.MD and now add that in the VCS.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ touch README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
Now you need to move it from Dev to Master. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "added README.md" 
This way you will not get a large msg. 


Now just see the logs, about who is doing what changes/ work:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log
You will get the details about push etc. 



Go into the Scripts folder if you are outside. Execute the command 'git status'. If you are getting 'nothing to commit...' msg then good.
Create a 'dev' branch. and you need to create files in that branch.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout -b dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
Create a file i.e 'from_dev.txt', and add some content in it. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
On branch dev...
You can see the from_dev.txt file in Untracked file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Added dev file"

Now we need to know that once you create any file in any particular branch, its only available for that branch.
As we have created the 'from_dev.txt' file in Dev branch.  We need to switch into master branch and need to see whether we 
are able to see the 'from_dev.txt' file in in Master branch or not. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git branch 
Above command will show on which branch you are currently. 

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Thalapathy.sh gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh
You will not be able to see the from_dev.txt file in master branch.

Now you need to see all the logs in oneline
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
You can see the latest commit in the branch
You can see the same on Dev Branch. 


Now as we know, there is one file i.e from_dev.txt is present only in Dev branch, but you need to add/ merge it into master branch.
Then first you need to go into the master branch.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git merge dev 
So now all the changes/ files of dev branch will be merged into the master.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh
now you can see that 'from_dev.txt' is now present in master branch as well.

# Local to Repo : adding local dir/ files in remote repo in GitHub
First create the repo in github i.e 'demo-shell-scripts'

Now you need to upload the files of this local dir into the remote repo i.e 'demo-shell-scripts'
First you need to have the Token with you. For that go to the settings of profile. Click on 'Developer Settings'. select ('Tokens' classic)
Create a new Token and give full repo permissions to it.
Once token is created, then copy and paste it somewhere (the toaken will once show up once.)

Now you need to check if your current local repository has already been connected to any report repo or not.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote -v
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ 

Now its saying that its not connected with any of remote repo. 
So now go to the repo you have created and click on 'code'. Now select/ copy the HTTPS code/ URL.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote add origin <paste-the-copied-HTTPS-URL>

Now if you push the files now, then it will ask for the credentials. so now set the URL with auth token.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url https://{paste-the-copied-token-here/}@github.com/{your-username/your-repo-name.git}
e.g 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url https://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/@github.com/BhimsenK/demo-shell-script.git

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin master
This will add the local dir data into public repo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

# From remote git repo to local 

Now create a new file in the remote repo. i.e from_remote.txt 
Now if you can check the files in repo through local machine, you cannot find the 'from_remote.txt' in your local repo. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh

Now you need to add that 'from_remote.txt' file from remote repo to local repo. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git pull origin master
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  from_remote.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh


Now create a file named 'from_local.txt' in your local repo and you need to push it into remote repo.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_local.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_local.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "added from local"
You can check the  remote repo and you can find this 'from_local.txt' file in there.


# Taking someones repository on our local repo. using SSH instead of HTTPS URL
Requirement : Local (private key) & Github (public key)

now come out of the Script folder.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ cd ..
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
Scripts  github

Now create a key in instance using keygen command.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ssh-keygen

Now go into the .ssh folder and check the files.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ cd .ssh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/.ssh$ ls
authorized_keys  id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub

Now open the public key and copy the key.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/.ssh$ cat id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGZ1diFeidEWSxkXnsTyb4eR1A+1TC+Ue7nf2p2tM09p ubuntu@ip-172

Now open Github >> settings >> SSH & KPG keys >> New SSH key >> give a name to a key and add the 
key name copied from instance and paste it here. 
and save it. 

Now 2 scinario's are ther. 
1. Any public repo to local.
2. Your own git repo.

*1. Any public repo to local repo : 
Open any public repo you want to have it in your local.
Then click on 'Code' and select the ssh URL. 

Now, come out of the 'Scripts' folder and create a new folder named i.e github_repo
go inside that folder. i.e 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
Scripts  github
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ mkdir github_repo
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
Scripts  github  github_repo
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ cd github_repo/
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ git clone git@github.com:LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps.git

And its done. You can now see your git repo on your local. 


2. Your own git repo :
same thing for own repo. 
Suppose we need to modify the 




#change the repo files details :
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ ls
90DaysOfDevOps  git-for-devops
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ cd git-for-devops/
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ ls
README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$


here, just modify the 'README.md'
Note : See on which branch you are now currently.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ vim README.md
update this or add some content in it. 

Now push the changes into remote repo 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git status
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git add README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git commit -m "Adding updated README.md in remote repo"
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git push origin main
we are pushing into main cause the current branch is 'main'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note : Github to github repo copy >> fork
       Github to local  repo      >> clone
	   


Assignment : 
clone : 90DaysOfDevOps repo
Fork  : 90DaysOfDevOps repo

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task : 
Clone any of your git remote repo into local repo.
Then add some new folder and files in it and then upload/ push the changes into remote from local repo.


new Task :
Fork the 90DaysOfDevOps remote repo or any other public repo.
Then clone it to your local repo. 
Add some changes into it. 
Then push the changes into remote repo. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Info
Branch : Default branching (Production)
	- Master : if created a repo in local	
	- main   : if created a repo in remote
	
	
==================================================================================================================================

## GitHub Advanced : 
- - - - - - - - - 

*AUTH token : Re-Generation of the token.
---
Delete the old token on github. Now try to push the local repo into remote repo. It will throw an error.
Now you need to generate another token. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url origin https://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@github.com/BhimsenK/demo-shell-scripts.git
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push --dry-run origin master
Once you have added the new token and set the url, then try to dry run a push operation. It will tell you whether the connection is successful or not.
Now push the local repo into remote repo once the connection is successful. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin master


*Branch : Adding dev branch into remote repo. 
---
check the available branches. you can see 'dev' & 'master'. But only 'master' branch is there on remote repo. So need to add 'dev' branch as well.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git branch
  dev
* master
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git switch dev
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git branch
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin dev
Now refresh the GitHub on browser and you can see the 'dev' branch also been added to it.


*Pull request : 
---
Go to the Dev Branch. Add some extra lines in 'hello.sh' file.  Then push the changes to remote repo.
Now you can see the changes only in Dev branch. 
And now you need to replicate these changes into your 'master' branch as well. 
So you need to go to GitHub, then click on pull request. 
Now in the first section, you need to select on which branch you need to merge the changes i.e 'Master'.
and in 2nd sec. you need to select from which branch i.e 'dev'
Now the PR is open so if you click on 'merge pull request' then the changes will be applied otherwise you can select cancel request. 
note : from cmd/ git bash you can go into the branch on which you want to merge i.e 'master' another branch i.e 'dev'.
	command : git merge dev     (this is on master branch.)


*Revert
---

Scenario 1: Reverting a in between commit of same file.

open a 'from_dev.txt' file and write one line. commit it as 'added fine commit'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "adding a fine commit"

again open a 'from_dev.txt' file and write one line. commit it as 'added a wrong commit'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "added a wrong commit"

open a 'from_dev.txt' file and write one line. commit it as 'added fine commit'
"ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "adding a fine commit" "

Now, 
"ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
 f541889 (HEAD -> dev) Added a fine commit
 cf4d956 added a wrong commit
 3b3a6f6 adding a fine commit"

we need to revert the changes happened from "cf4d956 added a wrong commit" this commit.
"ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git revert cf4d956
 Auto-merging from_dev.txt
 CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in from_dev.txt
 error: could not revert cf4d956... added a wrong commit"
Now this will throw an confict error. so,
"ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
 On branch dev
 You are currently reverting commit cf4d956.
   (fix conflicts and run "git revert --continue")
   (use "git revert --skip" to skip this patch)
   (use "git revert --abort" to cancel the revert operation)... "
We need to open the 'from_dev.txt' file again. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
in here, you will see the error msg in the file so you need to manually remove 
the part which has been added in wrong commit. then simply save it. 

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git revert --continue
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
919d2d3 (HEAD -> dev) Revert "added a wrong commit"

DONE !!!


Scenario 2: Reverting a last commit 
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
 cf4d956 added a wrong commit
 ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git revert cf4d956
 
DONE !!!
 
 
 
*Stashing & Poping: 
---
Scenario : WORK IN PROGRESS
           You are developing a script. You have added the initial script (whatever has been developed yet.)
           You are developing the code, but you are not sure whether its the 
           correct or not. You might change it later ydk.
		   

You have added some new lines in 'hello.sh' file. You have added it to git.
But you don't want to commit it now, as you need to do some other work you remembered that's in master branch.
So you are trying to change the branch. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git switch master
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        hello.sh
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$
Its  not allowing you to change the branch without commit/ or it will overwritten.

You need to stash it. So that for this branch, this status will get saved in stack.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on dev: 919d2d3 Revert "added a wrong commit"
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
On branch dev
nothing to commit, working tree clean

You went to 'master' branch, came back to 'dev' after completing some work there.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout dev
Switched to branch 'dev'

now you just need to pop the last state from the stack for this branch.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git stash pop
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ cat hello.sh
.
.
<<thalapathy
jai sherawali...tera shera aa gaya.....
bass maa ke wajahase chup hoon !!!
thalapathy
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$

here you can see the changes we have made are still there without commit. 



*cherrypicking : (if we merge 2 branchs then all the commits will merge. But if want to merge only a specific commit then cherry-pick comes in picture.)
---

You are on 'Dev' branch. You have created a file i.e 'demo_master.txt'.
You have added it to git and committed it, as 'Adding demo_master.txt'. 

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git switch dev
Switched to branch 'dev'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim demo_master.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add demo_master.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Adding demo_master.txt"
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
9ad3c41 (HEAD -> dev) Adding demo_master.txt
919d2d3 Revert "added a wrong commit"
f541889 Added a fine commit


Now outof all the commit logs, you only want to add that commit in which you 
have added the 'demo_master.txt' file i.e 9ad3c41

So you went to 'master' branch now. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git cherry-pick 9ad3c41
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
40e0265 (HEAD -> master) Adding demo_master.txt
54ed09a (origin/master) adding a new sample txt file

Now you can see that 'dev' branch commit into your 'master' branch commit logs.
Now that file is also present in 'master' branch. 



*Rebase :

it will create a linear logs of commits of the branch.

in Dev, there are separate log commits history.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout dev
Switched to branch 'dev'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
9ad3c41 (HEAD -> dev) Adding demo_master.txt
919d2d3 Revert "added a wrong commit"
f541889 Added a fine commit
cf4d956 added a wrong commit
...

In 'master' as well having its own log commit history. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
40e0265 (HEAD -> master) Adding demo_master.txt
54ed09a (origin/master) adding a new sample txt file
d50f055 added from local
5a71c3f Create from_remote.txt
97885ab added dev file
d7a3ddb Added README

But if we want to see the time wise log commits on both master & dev then,
go to 'master' branch. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git switch master
Switched to branch 'master'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git rebase dev
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
d87008f (HEAD -> master) adding a new sample txt file
6c6b8dd added from local
51016b1 Create from_remote.txt
9ad3c41 (dev) Adding demo_master.txt
919d2d3 Revert "added a wrong commit"
f541889 Added a fine commit
cf4d956 added a wrong commit
3b3a6f6 adding a fine commit
d95a16b (origin/dev) adding multi line comment from Dev Branch in hello.sh file
97885ab added dev file
d7a3ddb Added README
4230f96 Adding all the scripts
5333307 added Sholay Script

and here you go... you will get timewise log history regardless of dev & master branch.

```





#Your Practice tasks :

```
*Creating an instance and a folder/ files in it.
-----------------------------------------------
Create EC2 instance of Ubuntu. 
Create a 'Scripts' folder in it.
Create 4 .txt files in 'Scripts' folder. 
	- 1. gabbar_vs_thakur.txt 2. jai_vs_veeru.txt
	- 3. Kalia_vs_Bheem.txt   4. Kirmada_vs_Krishna.txt

*Initializing Empty git repo and adding file in it:
-----------------------------------------------
Initialise the empty git repo (folder) in the 'Scripts' folder.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git init 
Check the status of all the files whether there are in which stage ?
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status 
        - (You can see all the file in Red color i.e Untracked.)
Move 'gabbar_vs_thakur.txt' from 'Untracked' to 'Staged'.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add gabbar_vs_thakur.txt
Validate the file is in 'Staged' state or not.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
	- The file should be Green in color.
Move 'jai_vs_veeru.txt' file in 'Staged' state.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add jai_vs_veeru.txt
Ohh but this file don't need to be added in 'Staged', move it back to 'Untracked'
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git rm --cached jai_vs_veeru.txt
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
	- This file should be Red in color now. 
Move 'gabbar_vs_thakur.txt' from 'Staged' to 'Tracked'.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Adding Sholey movie script"
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
Delete the 'gabbar_vs_thakur.txt' file from 'Scripts' folder.
Now you need to restore that file using Version Control.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git restore gabbar_vs_thakur.txt
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls


*Configuring the user :
-----------------------------------------------
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git config --global user.name BhimsenK
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git config --global user.email kulkarnibhimsen4@gmail.com


*Creating and adding a README.md file:
-----------------------------------------------
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ touch README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status

*Creating a 'Dev' branch and adding new files into it : 
-----------------------------------------------
Create a new 'Dev' branch.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout -b dev
Create a file i.e 'from_dev.txt', and add some content in it. 
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Add this file in Dev branch and commit it.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Added dev file"
Now go to 'master' branch and check the 'from_dev.txt' is there or not.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls


*Merging 'Dev' branch into 'Master' branch:
-----------------------------------------------
Then first you need to go into the master branch.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git merge dev 
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
You will be getting the 'Dev' branch file in 'master'.


*Setting up the env/token to push the files to Github.
-----------------------------------------------

*Set the token in github and save it with you 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Go to the settings of profile. 
Click on 'Developer Settings'. select ('Tokens' classic)
give full repo permissions to it.
Once token is created, then copy and paste it somewhere (the toaken will once show up once.)

*set the remote repo
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Check if the current local repo is being connected with any remote repo or not.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote -v
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ 

*set the token 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Set the token into origin
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url https://{paste-the-copied-token-here/}@github.com/{your-username/your-repo-name.git}
	- e.g "ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url origin https://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@github.com/BhimsenK/demo-shell-scripts.git"


*Local repo to Remote repo:
-----------------------------------------------
Create a new repo in Github (online) named "demo-shell-scripts"
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin master

*From Remote repo to Local repo:
-----------------------------------------------
Create a file named 'From_remote.txt' in remote repo through Github GUI.
(Its present in remote repo, you need to show this in your local repo.)
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git pull origin master
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
You should be seen that remote file into your local repo now.



*Cloning remote repo into Local:
-----------------------------------------------

  *. Through SSH
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Come out of the Script folder.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ cd ..
Now create a key in instance using keygen command.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ssh-keygen
Now go into the .ssh folder and check the files.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ cd .ssh
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/.ssh$ ls
	  authorized_keys  id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
Now open the public key and copy the key.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/.ssh$ cat id_ed25519.pub
	  ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGZ1diFeidEWSxkXnsTyb4eR1A+1TC+Ue7nf2p2tM09p ubuntu@ip-172
Now open Github >> settings >> SSH & KPG keys >> New SSH key >> give a name to a key and add the key name copied from instance and paste it here. and save it. 

Open any public repo you want to have it in your local, Then click on 'Code' and select the ssh URL. 

Now, come out of the 'Scripts' folder and create a new folder named i.e github_repo
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ mkdir github_repo
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
	  Scripts  github_repo
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ cd github_repo/
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ git clone git@github.com:LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps.git
And its done. You can now see your git repo on your local. 




*update your repo with new/ old file with some updates
-----------------------------------------------
Clone any of your repo, create a new file in it and apply the changes
into remote repo.
Come outof the Scripts or any other folder and create a new folder. And clone
your repo in it.
Suppose your cloning repo has only one file.

	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/<YOUR_NEW_FOLDER>$ ls
	  README.md

here, just modify the 'README.md'
Note : See on which branch you are now currently.

	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/<YOUR_NEW_FOLDER>$ vim README.md
update this or add some content in it. 

Now push the changes into remote repo 
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/<YOUR_NEW_FOLDER>$ git status
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/<YOUR_NEW_FOLDER>$ git add README.md
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/<YOUR_NEW_FOLDER>$ git commit -m "Adding updated README.md in remote repo"
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/<YOUR_NEW_FOLDER>$ git push origin main
we are pushing into main cause the current branch is 'main' in the repo.
You can create any new branch if you want.


You are now ready to go into Next Level.

*Fork-Clone-Modify
-----------------------------------------------
Note : Github to github repo copy >> fork
       Github to local  repo      >> clone

Fork the 90DaysOfDevOps remote repo or any other public repo.
	- Note : Once you fork any repo, it become your repo now (copy of original repo)
Then clone it to your local repo. 
Update any file in it. 
Then push the changes into remote repo. 





Solo Levelling : GitHub Advance 
========================================================================


*Using new Auth-token:
-----------------------------------------------
Delete the Auth-token we have been added and using for our github.
Now try to push the local repo into remote repo. You will face error.
Generate New token and copy it somewhere.

Set the token.
	- Go to 'Scripts' folder.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url origin https://{REPLACE-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE}@github.com/BhimsenK/demo-shell-scripts.git
Test the connection.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push --dry-run origin master
Once its good, push the new changes to git remote repo.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin master



*Adding 'dev' branch repo into remote repo:
-----------------------------------------------
Scene : You are having a 'Dev' & 'master' branch on local repo. But on remote repo,
        you are having only 'master' branch. And you want to add your 'demo' branch
	from local to remote repo.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git branch
	   dev
	 * master
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git switch dev
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git branch
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin dev
Now refresh the GitHub on browser and you can see the 'dev' branch also been added to it.


*Reverting a particular commit:
-----------------------------------------------

*Within same file
- - - 
Create a file and Add some changes and do 3 commits. named as 'cmt 1', 'cmt 2' & 'cmt 3'

	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "cmt 1"
Likewise for all 3 commits.
Check the logs
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
	 f541889 (HEAD -> dev) Added a fine commit
	 cf4d956 added a wrong commit
	 3b3a6f6 adding a fine commit"
We need to rever the 'cf4d956' this commit.
Revert the commit.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git revert cf4d956
	  CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in from_dev.txt
You will get an error.
So open the file, and update/ remove the changes you want and use below command.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git revert --continue


*with different files
- - -
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
            cf4d956 added a wrong commit
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git revert cf4d956



*Stashing:
-----------------------------------------------
Scenario : WORK IN PROGRESS
           You are developing a script. You have added the initial script (whatever has been developed yet.)
           You are developing the code, but you are not sure whether its the 
           correct or not. You might change it later ydk.

Go into the 'dev' branch.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout dev
Do some modifications in the files and add it without commit.
Now try to go into 'master' branch.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
	You will face error, as you were working in another branch and without
	commiting anything you wanted to switch so.
Save the updation/ modification in dev branch.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git stash
Go to 'master' branch and came back to 'dev'.
And now fetch the last saved stash.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git stash pop
Now you can see the files with your modifications.


*cherrypicking : 
------------------------------------------------
(if we merge 2 branchs then all the commits will merge. 
But if want to merge only a specific commit then cherry-pick comes in picture.)

Go into 'dev' branch. Create and commit a new file there as 'Adding commit for master branch'.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
	  9ad3c41 (HEAD -> dev) Adding commit for master branch  (your commit)
Go into 'master' branch.
Cherry-pick the particular commit.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git cherry-pick 9ad3c41
Now check the log history.
	- ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
	You can now see the file/ commit in your 'master' branch

```
