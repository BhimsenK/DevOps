```
Create an EC2 instance. Create a 'Scripts' folder. and now Create some bash scripts in it. i.e "Thalapathy.sh", "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh", "hello.sh", "install_package.sh", "variables.sh".

Note : There are 3 stages. i.e Untracked (red), Staged (green) and Tracked. 

Now go into the Scripts folder i.e 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Thalapathy.s  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh


Now you need to initialize an Empty Git Repo in this folder i.e Scripts.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git init 

It will create an .git file in this folder. But to see all the hidden files, you need to use below command : 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh

To see all the files status, you need to use "git status" command. 
You can see all the files in Red color. Thats because those are currently Untracked Files.

Now you need to move the "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh" file from Untracked to Staged status. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add gabbar_vs_thakur.sh

Then use 'git status' command to check if the file has been moved into the Staged state or not. It should move into the Staged state.
You can see that particular file in Green color. 
Add another file i.e "variables.sh" into the Staged state. 

Imagine you didn't required to move "Variables.sh" file into Staged state, so you need to move it back into the Untracked state.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git rm --cached variables.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status 
Using "git status" you can see that now 'Variables.sh' file got moved back into the Untracked state. 

Now you need to move the "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh" file from Staged to Tracked state.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Adding Sholey movie script"
Now your file got Tracked state.


Now some one from your team, had mistakenly deleted the "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh" file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ rm gabbar_vs_thakur
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
You can see the file got removed. But it will be there in Version Control.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
You can see that some changes has happened. 
Now you need to get back that deleted file. i.e "gabbar_vs_thakur.sh"
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git restore gabbar_vs_thakur.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Restored !!! 


Note : To add all the files in the folder into Staged state, you can use "git add ." but don't use it. 

You will notice that after every action by you on GitHub, you are getting all the info. But you only want the requried one.
So now here you need to configure you git.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git config --global user.name BhimsenK
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git config --global user.email kulkarnibhimsen4@gmail.com
Now create a new file i.e README.MD and now add that in the VCS.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ touch README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
Now you need to move it from Dev to Master. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "added README.md" 
This way you will not get a large msg. 


Now just see the logs, about who is doing what changes/ work:
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log
You will get the details about push etc. 



Go into the Scripts folder if you are outside. Execute the command 'git status'. If you are getting 'nothing to commit...' msg then good.
Create a 'dev' branch. and you need to create files in that branch.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout -b dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
Create a file i.e 'from_dev.txt', and add some content in it. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git status
On branch dev...
You can see the from_dev.txt file in Untracked file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_dev.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "Added dev file"

Now we need to know that once you create any file in any particular branch, its only available for that branch.
As we have created the 'from_dev.txt' file in Dev branch.  We need to switch into master branch and need to see whether we 
are able to see the 'from_dev.txt' file in in Master branch or not. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git branch 
Above command will show on which branch you are currently. 

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
Thalapathy.sh gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh
You will not be able to see the from_dev.txt file in master branch.

Now you need to see all the logs in oneline
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git log --oneline
You can see the latest commit in the branch
You can see the same on Dev Branch. 


Now as we know, there is one file i.e from_dev.txt is present only in Dev branch, but you need to add/ merge it into master branch.
Then first you need to go into the master branch.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git checkout master
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git merge dev 
So now all the changes/ files of dev branch will be merged into the master.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh
now you can see that 'from_dev.txt' is now present in master branch as well.

# Local to Repo : adding local dir/ files in remote repo in GitHub
First create the repo in github i.e 'demo-shell-scripts'

Now you need to upload the files of this local dir into the remote repo i.e 'demo-shell-scripts'
First you need to have the Token with you. For that go to the settings of profile. Click on 'Developer Settings'. select ('Tokens' classic)
Create a new Token and give full repo permissions to it.
Once token is created, then copy and paste it somewhere (the toaken will once show up once.)

Now you need to check if your current local repository has already been connected to any report repo or not.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote -v
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ 

Now its saying that its not connected with any of remote repo. 
So now go to the repo you have created and click on 'code'. Now select/ copy the HTTPS code/ URL.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote add origin <paste-the-copied-HTTPS-URL>

Now if you push the files now, then it will ask for the credentials. so now set the URL with auth token.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url https://{paste-the-copied-token-here/}@github.com/{your-username/your-repo-name.git}
e.g 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git remote set-url https://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/@github.com/BhimsenK/demo-shell-script.git

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git push origin master
This will add the local dir data into public repo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

# From remote git repo to local 

Now create a new file in the remote repo. i.e from_remote.txt 
Now if you can check the files in repo through local machine, you cannot find the 'from_remote.txt' in your local repo. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh

Now you need to add that 'from_remote.txt' file from remote repo to local repo. 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git pull origin master
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ ls
REAMDME.md  Thalapathy.sh  from_dev.txt  from_remote.txt  gabbar_vs_thakur.sh  hello.sh  install_package.sh  variables.sh


Now create a file named 'from_local.txt' in your local repo and you need to push it into remote repo.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ vim from_local.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git add from_local.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ git commit -m "added from local"
You can check the  remote repo and you can find this 'from_local.txt' file in there.


# Taking someones repository on our local repo. using SSH instead of HTTPS URL
Requirement : Local (private key) & Github (public key)

now come out of the Script folder.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/Scripts$ cd ..
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
Scripts  github

Now create a key in instance using keygen command.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ssh-keygen

Now go into the .ssh folder and check the files.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ cd .ssh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/.ssh$ ls
authorized_keys  id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub

Now open the public key and copy the key.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/.ssh$ cat id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGZ1diFeidEWSxkXnsTyb4eR1A+1TC+Ue7nf2p2tM09p ubuntu@ip-172

Now open Github >> settings >> SSH & KPG keys >> New SSH key >> give a name to a key and add the 
key name copied from instance and paste it here. 
and save it. 

Now 2 scinario's are ther. 
1. Any public repo to local.
2. Your own git repo.

*1. Any public repo to local repo : 
Open any public repo you want to have it in your local.
Then click on 'Code' and select the ssh URL. 

Now, come out of the 'Scripts' folder and create a new folder named i.e github_repo
go inside that folder. i.e 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
Scripts  github
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ mkdir github_repo
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ ls
Scripts  github  github_repo
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~$ cd github_repo/
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ git clone git@github.com:LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps.git

And its done. You can now see your git repo on your local. 


2. Your own git repo :
same thing for own repo. 
Suppose we need to modify the 




#change the repo files details :
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ ls
90DaysOfDevOps  git-for-devops
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo$ cd git-for-devops/
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ ls
README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$


here, just modify the 'README.md'
Note : See on which branch you are now currently.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ vim README.md
update this or add some content in it. 

Now push the changes into remote repo 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git status
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git add README.md
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git commit -m "Adding updated README.md in remote repo"
ubuntu@ip-172-31-46-232:~/github_repo/git-for-devops$ git push origin main
we are pushing into main cause the current branch is 'main'.
