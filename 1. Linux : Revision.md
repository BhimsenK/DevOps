sudo useradd -m Jethalal, sudo passwd jethalal (set the password), su jethalal,
sudo useradd -m tappu -s /bin/bash, sudo passwd tappu, su tappu

# creating a html file that should be available in http : 
cd /var, cd www, sudo vim index.html (insert the html code, then copy the

Rivision of Linux Basics : Day 1/2 : TrainWithShubham

Great! Youâ€™ve shared a solid list of commands, and Iâ€™ll now create an interactive, story-like sequence that incorporates all of them. This will help you practice file operations, package management, and even hosting a simple HTML file using Nginx. Letâ€™s dive into the story!

### **Linux Command Practice Story: Setting Up a Web Server**

#### **Scenario:**
You are a DevOps engineer tasked with setting up a web server on a Linux machine. You need to organize files, install and configure Nginx, and deploy a simple HTML page. Follow the steps below to complete the task.

---

### **Part 1: File Operations**

#### **Step 1: Log in and Check Your Current Location**
1. Log in to your Linux shell.
2. Check the current directory you are in:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

#### **Step 2: Create a Directory for Your Project**
1. Create a new directory named `DevOps`:
   ```bash
   mkdir DevOps
   ```
2. Verify that the directory has been created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 3: Create a File in the DevOps Directory**
1. Move into the `DevOps` directory:
   ```bash
   cd DevOps
   ```
2. Create a new text file named `intro.txt`:
   ```bash
   touch intro.txt
   ```
3. Verify that the file has been created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 4: Create a Demo Directory and File**
1. Create a new directory named `demo`:
   ```bash
   mkdir demo
   ```
2. Move into the `demo` directory:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```
3. Create a new text file named `demo.txt`:
   ```bash
   touch demo.txt
   ```
4. Verify that the file has been created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 5: Clean Up the Demo Directory**
1. Go back to the parent directory (one level up):
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```
2. Remove the `demo` directory and its contents:
   ```bash
   rm -r demo
   ```
3. Verify that the directory has been deleted:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 6: Create and Edit Files**
1. Create a new text file named `new.txt`:
   ```bash
   touch new.txt
   ```
2. Open the `commands.txt` file in the `vim` editor and add some content:
   ```bash
   vim commands.txt
   ```
   - Press `i` to enter insert mode, type some text, then press `Esc` and type `:wq` to save and exit.
3. Display the contents of the `commands.txt` file:
   ```bash
   cat commands.txt
   ```
4. Open the `demo-file.txt` file in the `nano` editor and add some content:
   ```bash
   nano demo-file.txt
   ```
   - Add some text, then press `Ctrl + X`, followed by `Y` and `Enter` to save and exit.

### **Part 2: Package Management**

#### **Step 7: Update and Upgrade the System**
1. Update the package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. Upgrade the installed packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

#### **Step 8: Install and Manage Nginx**
1. Install the Nginx web server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```
2. Check the status of the Nginx service:
   ```bash
   systemctl status nginx
   ```
3. Stop the Nginx service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop nginx
   ```
4. Start the Nginx service again:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

### **Part 3: Hosting a Simple HTML Page**

#### **Step 9: Create an HTML File**
1. Navigate to the `/var/www` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in the `vim` editor:
   ```bash
   sudo vim index.html
   ```
3. Insert the following HTML code (press `i` to enter insert mode):
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My DevOps Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My DevOps World!</h1>
       <p>This is a simple HTML page hosted on Nginx.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   - Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` to save and exit.

#### **Step 10: Access Your Website**
1. Find the public IP address of your instance (you can get this from your cloud providerâ€™s console or use `curl ifconfig.me`).
2. Open a web browser and enter the following URL:
   ```
   http://<your-public-ip>:80
   ```
   - Replace `<your-public-ip>` with the actual IP address of your instance.
3. You should see your HTML page displayed!
