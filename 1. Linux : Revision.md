# The DevOps Chronicles  
## Chapter 1: The Linux Awakening Arc 

---

### **Prologue**  
You are a **DevOps Engineer** working for a startup called **CloudNova**. Your mission is to set up a web server for the company’s new project. Along the way, you’ll need to organize files, manage users, and deploy a website. But beware! The server is a mysterious place, and you’ll need to use your Linux skills to succeed.

---

### **Chapter 1: The Mysterious Server**  

#### **Scene 1: Logging into the Server**  
You receive an email from your boss:  
> **Subject:** Urgent: Set Up the Web Server  
> **Message:**  
> "We need you to log into the Linux server and set up a web server ASAP. The future of CloudNova depends on this! Use your Linux skills to get the job done. Good luck!"  

You take a deep breath and log into the server. The terminal greets you with a blinking cursor.  

---

#### **Your Task:**  
1. Check your current location in the server:  
   ```bash
   pwd
---

#### **Scene 2: Organizing the Workspace**  
Your boss sends another message:  
> "Before you start, create a directory called `DevOps` to organize all your files. Also, create a file named `intro.txt` to document your progress."  

---

#### **Your Task:**  
1. Create a directory named `DevOps`:  
   ```bash
   mkdir DevOps
   ```  
2. Verify the directory was created:  
   ```bash
   ls
   ```  
3. Move into the `DevOps` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd DevOps
   ```  
4. Create a file named `intro.txt`:  
   ```bash
   touch intro.txt
   ```  
5. Verify the file was created:  
   ```bash
   ls
   ```  

---

#### **Scene 3: The Disappearing Directory**  
Suddenly, you notice a strange directory named `demo` that you didn’t create. Your boss warns you:  
> "Be careful! That directory might contain malicious files. Delete it immediately."  

---

#### **Your Task:**  
1. Create a directory named `demo` (for the sake of the story):  
   ```bash
   mkdir demo
   ```  
2. Move into the `demo` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```  
3. Create a file named `demo.txt`:  
   ```bash
   touch demo.txt
   ```  
4. Verify the file was created:  
   ```bash
   ls
   ```  
5. Go back to the parent directory:  
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```  
6. Delete the `demo` directory and its contents:  
   ```bash
   rm -r demo
   ```  
7. Verify the directory was deleted:  
   ```bash
   ls
   ```  

---

#### **Scene 4: The Secret File**  
Your boss sends another message:  
> "We need you to create a file named `commands.txt` and document all the commands you’ve used so far. Also, create a file named `demo-file.txt` and add some notes."  

---

#### **Your Task:**  
1. Create a file named `commands.txt`:  
   ```bash
   touch commands.txt
   ```  
2. Open the file in the `vim` editor and add the commands you’ve used:  
   ```bash
   vim commands.txt
   ```  
   - Press `i`, type the commands, then press `Esc` and type `:wq` to save and exit.  
3. Display the contents of the file:  
   ```bash
   cat commands.txt
   ```  
4. Create a file named `demo-file.txt`:  
   ```bash
   touch demo-file.txt
   ```  
5. Open the file in the `nano` editor and add some notes:  
   ```bash
   nano demo-file.txt
   ```  
   - Add some text, then press `Ctrl + X`, followed by `Y` and `Enter` to save and exit.

### **Chapter 2: The Web Server Saga**  

#### **Scene 5: Installing Nginx**

   ```

#### **Scene 6: Deploying the Website**
