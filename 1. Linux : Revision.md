Rivision of Linux Basics : Day 1/2 : TrainWithShubham

Absolutely! Let’s expand the story to include user management tasks. We’ll add steps to create users, set passwords, switch between users, and verify their configurations. This will make the story more comprehensive and help you practice user-related commands.

### **Updated Linux Command Practice Story: Setting Up a Web Server and Managing Users**

#### **Scenario:**
You are a DevOps engineer tasked with setting up a web server on a Linux machine and managing user accounts for your team. You need to organize files, install and configure Nginx, deploy a simple HTML page, and create user accounts for your team members (Jethalal and Tappu). Follow the steps below to complete the task.

---

### **Part 1: File Operations**

#### **Step 1: Log in and Check Your Current Location**
1. Log in to your Linux shell.
2. Check the current directory you are in:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

#### **Step 2: Create a Directory for Your Project**
1. Create a new directory named `DevOps`:
   ```bash
   mkdir DevOps
   ```
2. Verify that the directory has been created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 3: Create a File in the DevOps Directory**
1. Move into the `DevOps` directory:
   ```bash
   cd DevOps
   ```
2. Create a new text file named `intro.txt`:
   ```bash
   touch intro.txt
   ```
3. Verify that the file has been created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 4: Create a Demo Directory and File**
1. Create a new directory named `demo`:
   ```bash
   mkdir demo
   ```
2. Move into the `demo` directory:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```
3. Create a new text file named `demo.txt`:
   ```bash
   touch demo.txt
   ```
4. Verify that the file has been created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 5: Clean Up the Demo Directory**
1. Go back to the parent directory (one level up):
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```
2. Remove the `demo` directory and its contents:
   ```bash
   rm -r demo
   ```
3. Verify that the directory has been deleted:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

#### **Step 6: Create and Edit Files**
1. Create a new text file named `new.txt`:
   ```bash
   touch new.txt
   ```
2. Open the `commands.txt` file in the `vim` editor and add some content:
   ```bash
   vim commands.txt
   ```
   - Press `i` to enter insert mode, type some text, then press `Esc` and type `:wq` to save and exit.
3. Display the contents of the `commands.txt` file:
   ```bash
   cat commands.txt
   ```
4. Open the `demo-file.txt` file in the `nano` editor and add some content:
   ```bash
   nano demo-file.txt
   ```
   - Add some text, then press `Ctrl + X`, followed by `Y` and `Enter` to save and exit.

### **Part 2: Package Management**

#### **Step 7: Update and Upgrade the System**
1. Update the package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. Upgrade the installed packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

#### **Step 8: Install and Manage Nginx**
1. Install the Nginx web server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```
2. Check the status of the Nginx service:
   ```bash
   systemctl status nginx
   ```
3. Stop the Nginx service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop nginx
   ```
4. Start the Nginx service again:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

### **Part 3: Hosting a Simple HTML Page**

#### **Step 9: Create an HTML File**
1. Navigate to the `/var/www` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in the `vim` editor:
   ```bash
   sudo vim index.html
   ```
3. Insert the following HTML code (press `i` to enter insert mode):
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My DevOps Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My DevOps World!</h1>
       <p>This is a simple HTML page hosted on Nginx.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   - Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` to save and exit.

#### **Step 10: Access Your Website**
1. Find the public IP address of your instance (you can get this from your cloud provider’s console or use `curl ifconfig.me`).
2. Open a web browser and enter the following URL:
   ```
   http://<your-public-ip>:80
   ```
   - Replace `<your-public-ip>` with the actual IP address of your instance.
3. You should see your HTML page displayed!

### **Part 4: Working with Different Users**

#### **Step 11: Create a User for Jethalal**
1. Create a new user named `Jethalal` with a home directory:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m Jethalal
   ```
2. Set a password for `Jethalal`:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd Jethalal
   ```
   - Enter and confirm the password when prompted.

#### **Step 12: Switch to the Jethalal User**
1. Switch to the `Jethalal` user:
   ```bash
   su Jethalal
   ```
2. Check the current user:
   ```bash
   whoami
   ```
3. Navigate to the home directory of `Jethalal`:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```
4. Verify the current directory:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

#### **Step 13: Create a User for Tappu**
1. Switch back to the root or your main user:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
2. Create a new user named `Tappu` with a home directory and set the default shell to `/bin/bash`:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m Tappu -s /bin/bash
   ```
3. Set a password for `Tappu`:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd Tappu
   ```
   - Enter and confirm the password when prompted.

#### **Step 14: Switch to the Tappu User**
1. Switch to the `Tappu` user:
   ```bash
   su Tappu
   ```
2. Check the current user:
   ```bash
   whoami
   ```
3. Navigate to the home directory of `Tappu`:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```
4. Verify the current directory:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
