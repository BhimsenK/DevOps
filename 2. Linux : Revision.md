# Connecting EC2 to EC2 :  
-------------------------------------------------------
Linux A to Linux B

- We need to create the private key on "Linux A" and public key on "Linux B".

On Linux A : (From our local machine after connection)

- ls -a   (This will show the hidden files)
- cd .ssh (Need to go into .ssh)
- ssh-keygen (To create the SSH ID)


ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-139:~/.ssh$ ls
authorized_keys  id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-139:~/.ssh$ cat id_ed25519 (This is a private key)

Note : Private key should be in "Linux A". Now we have both private & public
       keys in "Linux A". So we need to share/ copy the public key in "Linux B".

Now we login in "Linux B" instance.

- cd .ssh (As public keys are stored in '.ssh' so)
- ls (It will show the authorized_keys file.)
- vim authorized_keys (Press i and enter in insert mode. Now copy the public
                       key from "Linux A" using 'cat id_ed25519.pub' command
                       and paste it in "Linux B".)

-  ssh -i id_ed25519 ubuntu@13.61.11.233 (This IP is the public IP of 'Linux B').
And this will connect with "Linux B". 


** Assignment Question : From "A" to "B" copy the any one file using scp command.
ANS : 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-139:~$ scp /home/ubuntu/intro.txt ubuntu@13.61.11.233:/home/ubuntu/server_B
intro.txt                                                   100%   57    69.2KB/s   00:00

note : ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-139 (Linux A)
/home/ubuntu/intro.txt (intro.txt file path from Linux A)
ubuntu@13.61.11.233 : (Linux B user @ public IP)
/home/ubuntu/server_B/intro.txt : (Linux B destination where the file to be stored)



# File operations : 
---------------------

- cat /etc/passwd (To see all the users)
- cat /etc/group  (To see all the groups)

- sudo groupadd devops (Creating a new group)

Note : If you create a user i.e Tappu, then it will be created as a user as well as
       a group. so there will be 'Tappu' named 'user and group'.
       But if you create a group i.e 'devops' then it will only create a group,
       and not a user.

- sudo groupadd tester


- sudo gpasswd -M babitaji,aiyyer devops  (Adding them in a same group.)
- cat /etc/group  (You can see them in same group i.e devops)

- sudo gpasswd -M babitaji,bhide tester (adding them into tester group.)

* Another way of adding users in a group
- sudo usermod -aG devops goli (adding goli in devops group.) 

* Permissions : 
read write execute
4    2     1

giving only read permission to a file : 

e.g -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   73 Feb  1 15:50 commands.txt
- ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-139:~$ chmod  400 commands.txt
> -r-------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   73 Feb  1 15:50 commands.txt


Q. Changing owner & group of commands.txt from ubuntu to aiyyer.
- sudo chown aiyyer commands.txt
- sudo chgrp aiyyer commands.txt

-----------------------------------------


* creating a log file by putting logs from git hub repo.

- mkdir logs
- cd logs
- vim app.log
- ls


* grep
Now from the logs, 
1. only find the logs where 'Authentication failure' happened.
- grep -i "authentication failure" app.log (-i: for case insensitive)

2. fetch only first 10 rows data : 
- grep -i "authentication failure" app.log | head -n 10

3. fetch only last 10 rows data : 
- grep -i "authentication failure" app.log | tail -n 10

* awk
4. fetch for which user we got 'authentication failure'
- awk '{print}' app.log  (will print complete data)
- awk '/authentication failure/ {print}' app.log (will print only auth fail logs)
- awk '/authentication failure/ {print $12,$13,$14,$15}' app.log| tail -n 5 

5. Fetch only last 5 data of June month : 
- awk '/authentication failure/ { if ($1 == "Jun") print }' app.log| tail -n 5

save the output in a text file named 'auth_failure_ips.txt'
- awk '/authentication failure/ { if ($1 == "Jun") print }' app.log| tail -n 5 > 'auth_failure_ips.txt'


*sed
From the output file, replace the 'user' word with 'username'
- sed "s/user/username/g" auth_failure_ips.txt

Q. Remove duplicate values from the file 
- sed "s/rhost/IP/g" auth_failure_ips.txt | uniq


* find
Find the app.log file : 
- find . -name app.log



-----------------------------

# API 

url : https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2
1. Connect with the URL
- curl -X GET https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

2. Adjust the output using json format
- curl -X GET https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2 | jq

   vim authorized_keys
   ```  
   - Press **`i`** to enter insert mode.  
   - **Copy the public key from Linux A** (`cat id_ed25519.pub` on Linux A) and paste it here.  
   - Press **`Esc`**, type **`:wq`**, and hit **Enter** to save.  

4️⃣ **Test the connection from Linux A to Linux B**  
   ```bash
   ssh -i id_ed25519 ubuntu@13.61.11.233
   ```

## **🔥 Chapter 4: The File Transfer Quest**  

### **Scene 3: The Sacred Transfer of Files**  
Your boss sends another task:  
> "**Now that the connection is established, transfer a file from Linux A to Linux B using `scp`. The future of our data security depends on it!**"  

---  

### **🛠️ Your Task:**  
1️⃣ **Copy `intro.txt` from Linux A to Linux B**  
   ```bash
   scp /home/ubuntu/intro.txt ubuntu@13.61.11.233:/home/ubuntu/server_B

## **🔥 Chapter 6: The Quest for Log Analysis**  

### **Scene 5: Investigating the Authentication Failures**  
Your boss sends another message:  
> "**Suspicious login attempts have been detected! Use Linux commands to analyze the logs.**"  

---  

### **🛠️ Your Task:**  
1️⃣ **Find all logs where authentication failures occurred**  
   ```bash

   ```bash
   awk '/authentication failure/ { if ($1 == "Jun") print }' app.log | tail -n 5 > auth_failure_ips.txt
   ```  
6️⃣ **Replace the word "user" with "username" in the log file**  
   ```bash
   sed "s/user/username/g" auth_failure_ips.txt
   ```  

💡 **Success!** You have uncovered the secrets of the authentication failures.
